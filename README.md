GENERAL:
The app should keep track of:
    1)date created/uploaded
    2)date modified
    3)owner (user who uploaded the file)
    4)tags

4) CHALLENGES:
Initially our group decided to set up our data base 


5) FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:

    *Currently owners can set up tags, but in the future we want set up the ability for visitors to search by tags.
